# Logistic Regression Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression from scratch to classify breast cancer data. The model was trained using gradient descent, with iterative updates to weights and bias based on calculated gradients to minimize the loss function. 

### Key Highlights:
- **Training Process**: Gradient descent was employed to optimize the model parameters, minimizing the loss function.
- **Performance Evaluation**: 
  - Changes in loss were tracked during training to evaluate the model's learning process.
  - Accuracy on a test set was calculated to assess the classifier's effectiveness.
- **Visualization**: A loss trend graph was plotted to provide insights into the model's convergence behavior.
